Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:

- Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
- I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
- I included a link to a PDF of my resume (not current).
- I included a recent photo of myself.
- The projects presented in the My Work section include a couple of sample programs I have worked on for the bootcamp as well as some placeholder applications that will be added to as I complete more applications in the bootcamp and on my own.
- The non-placholder applications will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on.
- The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.
- I also included some on hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page.
